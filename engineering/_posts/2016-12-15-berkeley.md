I studied mechanical engineering with a concentration in design at my graduate studies at UC 
Berkeley. My primary research project was renovating an electric go-kart DSP control system
for use as a base testing vehicle for flywheel kinetic energy recovery. Additional class projects
included an attachment for handheld drills to achieve drill-press depth and perpendicularity
 performance, and a remote-activated color tracking NERF turret sentry.
