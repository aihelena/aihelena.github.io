At Spin, I was responsible for designing the front fork subsystem of the scooter and scaling to mid-volume production. I designed components to be manufactured via extrusion, stamping, and injection molding, and I communicated with overseas suppliers to specify material selection and cosmetic finishes. I worked with manufacturing, reliability, and quality teams to ensure the part design, test plans, and assembly process reflected our goal of easily serviceable parts that could withstand daily use as shared fleet vehicles. I also achieved sustaining improvements in a second-generation design of our scooter, including retrofit sensor attachments and stronger load-bearing components.
