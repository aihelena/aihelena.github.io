As part of a project for the Design and Manufacturing II class in undergrad, I designed
the outer snap-fit retaining ring for this yo-yo assembly, programmed the CNC machining process for the core
and cavity, and produced two manufacturing runs of 100 injection molded parts, altering the process
parameters between production runs to achieve desired quality of output.
