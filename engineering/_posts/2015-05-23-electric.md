As an undergraduate student, I designed and built several small personal electric vehicles,
including a tiny go-kart built around a 18" tractor wheel and powered with an aircraft hobby 
motor. I built a battery pack and retrofit a chopper bicycle to become an e-bike for my senior
thesis, and also assisted in the power electronics design and industrial design of an outdoor 
resistance bike for my senior capstone class. As an undergraduate researcher, I created a CAD
database of go-kart parts for modular designs requiring minimal fabrication resources for assembly, 
and fabricated a finished go-kart based on parametric response to desired custom inputs.
