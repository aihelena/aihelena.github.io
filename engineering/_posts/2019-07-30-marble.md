At Marble Robot, I worked as a mechanical engineer on cross-functional projects, including 
designing hardware integration of visual indicator lights and networking antennas to improve 
LTE video streaming performance, robot fleet charging and data offload station concepts, remote-activated
delivery robot deployment, and various fixtures for camera feed testing and image stitching.
