At Alta Motors, I was part of the electronics manufacturing team and provided mechanical support
for manual assembly of battery packs and other electronic motorcycle components. I designed fixtures for
assembly and leak testing, completed material handling solutions for the manufacturing line, and 
deployed MES-integrated mechanical systems for manual and semi-automatic assembly.
