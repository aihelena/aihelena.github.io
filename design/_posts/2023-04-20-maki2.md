Inspired by Daft Punk's work and the visuals of the film, <i>Tron: Legacy</i>, this helmet
was designed to incorporate elements of cyberpunk neon and sound-reactive lighting. 

An initial version was shaped from foam and used to make a silicone mold. The final helmet
was rotocast in white plastic and finished with a layer of carbon fiber-kevlar composite weave.
EL wire accents are inlaid on routed paths in the carbon fiber layer, and the visor is 
thermoformed and tinted PETG.
