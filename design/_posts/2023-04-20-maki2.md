I constructed this cosplay of Maki Zen'in (*Jujutsu Kaisen*) in her post-Shibuya Incident character design for Sakura-Con 2023. I altered the leg taper and waistband of the original vintage cotton twill pants. The wig was purchased from Epic Cosplay Wigs, and I trimmed, thinned, and styled the wig to match the character. 

The arm scars are hand-painted using Mehron water-based body paint and sealed with Ben Nye matte setting spray. The Split Soul katana is planned as a future cosplay prop addition.
