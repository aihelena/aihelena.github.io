I constructed this cosplay of Maki Zen'in (*Jujutsu Kaisen*) for Crunchyroll Expo 2022. The uniform is sewn from navy suiting, and I added custom alterations to the pattern for the collar, lapel, and closures. The wig was purchased as a straight wig from Arda Wigs, and I added wefts to hide the back hairline after thinning and styling as a ponytail. 

The *naginata* weapon was constructed from a broom handle, a 3D-printed adapter hilt that I designed and modeled in SolidWorks, and bonded and sanded EVA foam blade. I modeled the Tokyo Jujutsu High button and 3D printed it on a resin printer, and finished it using custom gold enamel paint.
