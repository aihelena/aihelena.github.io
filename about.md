		<p>I've lived all over, from brief stints in Arkansas and Illinois to growing up in
		South Carolina, spending time in Switzerland, and now residing in San Francisco. 
		On the way, I've completed an undergraduate education at MIT and a master's degree
		at UC Berkeley, both in mechanical engineering. I minored in creative writing.<br> <br>
		I'm interested in the ways we interact with the physical world, whether that's things on wheels,
		mechanism design, visual language, or conscious consumption. You can often find me looking for 
		the perfectly optimized version of a consumer product, 
		solving a puzzle hunt, 
		practicing new ways to tear myself apart while dancing, 
		or shaking up a creative cocktail for a friend.</p>

					<h3>Engineering work</h3>
				</header>
				<p>After being introduced to mechanical engineering through FIRST robotics, 
				I went on to build electric go-karts in college and assembled an e-bike with a 
				custom battery pack for my thesis. I moved to Berkeley to continue working on
				electric vehicles for my graduate studies, and found my first job after graduation
				as a manufacturing engineer at Alta Motors. My most recent engineering experience has
				been at Marble Robot.

					<h3>Interactive art</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I have been known to create art on occasion. I've worked on two art cars for Burning
				Man, primarily in lighting design and electronics integration. My other projects at the
				intersection of art and technology include a two-stage puzzle cryptex and a sound-reactive
				carbon fiber Daft Punk helmet.

					<h3>Visual design</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Some of my work doesn't fit neatly into a category of engineering or art.
				I created and ran a fundraising campaign for the Burning Man art car I helped design.
				I've dabbled in visual and UX design to create a set of logos for personal use, 
				as well as the navigation and layout of this website.
