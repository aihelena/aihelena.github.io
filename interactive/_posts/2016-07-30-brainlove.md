Dr. Brainlove was an art car for Burning Man that held the distinction from 2014-2016 of having the
most LEDs on any piece of art on playa (12,000 LEDs). Modeled from a 3D scan of an actual brain, 
the downsampled mesh comprised 700 unique steel bars, wrapped with LEDs and corrugated plastic to
render the structure climbable. The entire brain mounted to a gutted school bus. 

In 2016, I helped redesign the power distribution system, allowing the last 20% of LEDs at the
top of the brain to be lit for the first time. I also assisted in the general renovation and build
of the brain and bus, including the weeklong assembly process in the desert.
