Inspired by the cryptex from Dan Brown's <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, this puzzle box was designed
with a two-stage unlock mechanism. After entering the keyphrase found by solving an accompanying
written puzzle, the tumblers release the first chamber as a telescoping extension, as well as a
second set of written puzzles. The answer from this second set of puzzles is re-entered onto the
tumblers of the cryptex while open at the first section to release the final, inner chamber. 

The endcaps were CNC machined from aluminum. The lettered rings and waterjet aluminum spacers stack onto
a machined aluminum tube with hand-milled retaining features. The lettered rings and interior
chambers were 3d printed with a combination of SLS and FDM.
