Mimsy was an art car structure created for Burning Man 2017. Comprising ten tetrahedra within a 
dodecahedron laid with over 10,000 individually-addressible LEDs, the sculpture is fully climbable. 

Each LED strip includes two custom wire harnesses and receives power from the bank of power supplies
in the undercarriage of the driving base. In 2017, I co-led electronics design and power integration, 
and in 2018 I led electronics fabrication and redesign, as well as team coordination.
